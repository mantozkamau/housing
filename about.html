      Rent Management
    </h2>
    <p>
When a property management company begins overseeing your property, they take on many responsibilities including the management of rent.<br> It is their duty to set the proper rent price of the property. They base the price on several crucial factors.
<br> Utilizing a property management company for this is very important because they have the expert, in-depth knowledge of the most current real estate trends.<br> Their talent of strategic pricing will make you the most money as an investor.
Collecting rent from tenants will also be handled by your property management company. <br> If a tenant does not submit theirpayment slips on time, it is the property manager’s job to enforce late fees to prevent future late payments.
It is also important to note that your property management company will strive to keep your property competitive in the market<br> 
    </p>
    <h2 id="subheadings">
      Management of Tenants
    </h2>
    <p>
      Like all property management companies, E-Realtors takes full responsibility for your current and potential tenants.<br> We consider ourselves experts in finding and vetting out quality occupants for your property.<br> Did you know that a knowledge of marketing and advertising is essential and you can achieve that through the internet? <br>Perfecting a technique for finding responsible and reliable people to occupy your property takes time and a lot of trial and error.<br> At E-Realtors, we have had years to get it right and we celebrate continued success in this area. <!--We can even offer our expert tips on making your property more appealing to the right type of tenant.-->

If any of the terms in the lease are not met by the tenant, the property management company is relied upon to handle evictions.<br> Regular move-ins and move-outs are also coordinated by management on the website. Upon move-out, the property must be checked thoroughly .</p>
    <h2 id="subheadings">
      Law
    </h2>
    <P>
      Before renting out your property, ask yourself, “How much do I know about Landlord-Tenant Law?”. If the answer is not much, <br>then you should utilize a property management company. They have a deep knowledge of all laws pertaining to landlord and tenant relationships.<br>  The handling of security deposits and lease agreements also come with a multitude of laws. And of course, there are several legalities<br> involved when it comes to breaking a lease or evicting a person from a property. It makes sense to partner with a property management company who works with these laws every day<br> instead of trying to take them on alone.
